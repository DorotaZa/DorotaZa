### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Dorota Zak
#### Design and Development
I am Dorota Å»ak, a software developer with a strong background in architectural design.
My architectural background has provided me with a unique perspective as a software developer. I am passionate about combining my technical skills with my interest in graphic design.

Throughout my journey with IT, which started in 2022, I have cultivated my creativity and developed exceptional attention to detail. This has enabled me to acquire programming knowledge in C++ and explore the realm of web development. In my web designs, I utilize HTML and CSS as my foundational tools and employ JavaScript to add interactivity. As my passion for front-end development continues to grow, I eagerly explore various JavaScript libraries to enhance my capabilities.

Skills: C++ / HTML / CSS / JS / SKETCHUP / VRAY / AUTOCAD / PHOTOSHOP
